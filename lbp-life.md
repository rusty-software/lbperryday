# Cards

* Sam's Distraction: Coldplay decides to play a surprise concert on Friday evening somewhere within a three hour drive of LBP.  If you're playing as Sam, lose a turn unless you're currently eating raw cookie dough, in which case, take another bit of cookie dough and roll again.

* STOP LOOKING AT MY CARDS!  You get caught looking at Curtis's cards; lose a turn, unless you're playing as Curtis, in which case, take another drink and roll again.

* Bill's Naughty Past: Bill becomes suspiciously aroused while perusing a copy of "Bovine Boudoir."  If you're playing as Bill, lose a turn, unless you can convince everyone else playing that you really don't miss teat dipping, in which case, take another peak at a magazine and roll again.

* 40-yard Dash: Drunk Chase and Drunk Phil decide to race down the 40-yard hallway.  Roll the dice twice (if either Chase or Phil are playing, they get to roll) -- highest roll wins the race.  In either case, players for Phil and Chase take a drink.  Everyone else cheers and moves forward one space.

* Conference Calls: You show up to LBP completely beaten down, and instead of reveling in the company of your fellow LPBers, you immediately get on a conference call to support a production rollout.  If you're playing as Phil, lose a turn, unless you say "FUCK YOU, WORK!", in which case take a drink and take another turn.

* Rocket Ship Tito: Tony has signed up for Friday morning golf.  Unfortunately for him, Damon(?) forced him to consume ridiculous amounts of various and sundry boozes, and he is forced to sleep like the dead.  If you're playing as Tony, lose a turn, unless both Chase and Rusty can either guilt you into coming, or Damon has been searching for the Man Down, in which case take a drink and roll again.

* Return To Your Roots: Todd finally convinces the group to return to Possum Kingdom for some real camping.  On the first evening, Todd stubs his toe, splitting it open to a degree that it requires sutures.  If neither Sam nor Po are playing, lose two turns due to infection.  If only Po is playing, lose a turn unless you agree to a vascetomy on the spot.  If Sam is playing, roll again, unless he's gone to see Coldplay this game.

* Arts and Crafts: Everyone that has legitimately participated in Arts and Crafts activities this year moves forward one space.

* Man Down!: You throw a beer to someone in the pool, but overshoot.  The beer lands somewhere it cannot be found.  Lose a turn unless you're playing as Damon, in which case yell "I've rescued the Man Down!" and take another drink and turn.

* A New Business Venture: Bill and Keith begin talking about what they've been up to this year, and suddenly realize that they're both silent partners in a teat dipping professional services consultancy.  They celebrate their new partnership by playing Civ 5 for the rest of LBP.  Lose a turn if you're playing as either Bill or Keith, unless you can prove you aren't in any business venture together, in which case take a drink and roll again.

* Neverending Guac: The ingredients are purchased, the house is relatively quiet.  All that's left to do is

* BitTorrent Blight: Upon connecting your rig to the massive TV, the doorbell rings.  Two men in suits and sunglasses walk in, demanding to see the proof of purchase for all content on your hard drive.  If you are playing as Tai, lose a turn, unless you can convince someone to take the fall for you (or Keith still has your hard drive from last year), in which case take a drink and roll again.
