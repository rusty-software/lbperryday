# Cards

* **Sam's Distraction**: Coldplay decides to play a surprise concert on Friday evening somewhere within a three hour drive of LBP.  If you're playing as Sam, lose a turn unless you're currently eating raw cookie dough, in which case, take another bit of cookie dough and roll again.

* **STOP LOOKING AT MY CARDS!**:  You get caught looking at Curtis's cards; lose a turn, unless you're playing as Curtis, in which case, take another drink and roll again.

* **Bill's Naughty Past**: Bill becomes suspiciously aroused while perusing a copy of "Bovine Boudoir."  If you're playing as Bill, lose a turn, unless you can convince everyone else playing that you really don't miss teat dipping (ruling by simple majority), in which case, take another peak at a magazine and roll again.

* **40-yard Dash**: Drunk Chase and Drunk Phil decide to race down the 40-yard hallway.  Roll the dice twice (if either Chase or Phil are playing, they get to roll) -- highest roll wins the race.  Everyone else must cheer for your preferred stallion. Winner moves forward two spaces, loser moves forward one.  In either case, players for Phil and Chase take a drink.  Anyone that did NOT race or cheer moves back a space.

* **Conference Calls**: You show up to LBP completely beaten down, and instead of reveling in the company of your fellow LPBers, you immediately get on a conference call to support a production rollout.  If you're playing as Phil, lose a turn to make the call, unless you say "FUCK YOU, WORK!", in which case take a drink and roll again.

* **Rocket Ship Tito**: Tony has signed up for Friday morning golf.  Unfortunately for him, Damon(?) forced him to consume ridiculous amounts of various and sundry boozes, and he is forced to sleep like the dead.  If you're playing as Tony, lose a turn, unless both Chase and Rusty can either guilt you into coming, or Damon has been searching for the Man Down, in which case take a drink and roll again.

* **Return To Your Roots**: Todd finally convinces the group to return to Possum Kingdom for some real camping.  On the first evening, Todd stubs his toe, splitting it open to a degree that it requires sutures.  If neither Sam nor Po are playing, lose two turns due to infection.  If only Po is playing, lose a turn unless you agree to a vasectomy on the spot.  If Sam is playing, roll again, unless he's gone to see Coldplay this game.

* **Arts and Crafts**: Everyone that has legitimately participated in Arts and Crafts activities this year moves forward one space (simple majority judges participation level).

* **Man Down!**: You throw a beer to someone in the pool, but overshoot.  The beer lands somewhere it cannot be found.  Lose a turn unless you're playing as Damon, in which case yell "I've rescued the Man Down!" and take another drink and turn.

* **A New Business Venture**: Bill and Keith begin talking about what they've been up to this year, and suddenly realize that they're both silent partners in a teat dipping professional services consultancy.  They celebrate their new partnership by playing Civ 5 for the rest of LBP.  Lose a turn if you're playing as either Bill or Keith, unless you can prove you aren't in any business venture together, in which case take a drink and roll again.

* **Neverending Guac**: The ingredients are purchased, the house is relatively quiet.  All that's left to do is make the guac!  If you're playing as Garner, lose a turn to make the guac, unless Garner has actually finished the guac by now, in which case eat a chip (preferably with guac), take a drink, and roll again.

* **BitTorrent Blight**: Upon connecting your rig to the massive TV, the doorbell rings.  Two men in suits and sunglasses walk in, demanding to see the proof of purchase for all content on your hard drive.  If you are playing as Tai, lose a turn, unless you can convince someone to take the fall for you (or Keith still has your hard drive from last year), in which case take a drink and roll again.

* **Golfing Through Fire**: Once again, the annual golf tournament, which was supposed to begin by 10, didn't actually begin until noon.  Lose a turn while suffering from subsequent dehydration, unless you actually played and enjoyed golf this trip, in which case take a drink of WATER to roll again.

* **Spades For Days**: The spades games have been more interesting and slightly less friendly than usual this year, resulting in your not having enough money for the buy-in for the poker tournament (or for gas money to get home).  Lose a turn in order to determine what body part to auction off to pay your debts, unless you're playing as Nick, in which case smile wryly and roll again.

* **Lack of Reading Material**: You typically use your time at LBP to read as well as catch up with old friends.  This year, inexplicably, you neglected to pack your book bag.  If you're playing as Rusty, lose a turn searching the house for something worth reading, unless there is alternate reading material (the kind with pictures) within arm's reach, in which case show your favorite to everyone playing and roll again.

* **Scheduling Conflicts**: Even though LBP's date was settled six months in advance, Po was unable to attend due to his older and wiser partners scheduling the entire summer off, leaving him on call for three months straight.  Lose a turn if you're playing as Po, unless Po pulled a surprise attendance, in which case you should roll again while either telling the tale of how you managed attendance or taking another drink.

* **Sleeping Arrangements**: While you thought you would beat the LBP traffic this year by arriving at noon on Thursday, it turns out everyone else spent Wednesday night in Chase's back yard and got there before you.  Lose a turn trying to figure out where you're going to sleep, unless you're playing as Garner, in which case demonstrate that you can sleep anywhere by pulling any two objects of similar height together and planking on them, and then roll again.

* **I'm (Not) On A Boat!**: While out on the lake, you decide to get out of the water to pee for some reason.  While relieving yourself, the boats (because there are two) departing, both thinking that you're on the other one. Lose a turn hitchhiking back to the cabin unless you can spin an entertaining tale of how you beat the boats back (simple majority rules), in which case roll again.

* **Cheetos And Strife**: You go looking for two LBP snack staples: cheetos and beer.  Unfortunately, someone has consumed the last of both without notifying the authorities, and you begin to exhibit withdrawal symptoms. Lose a turn making a store run unless you've actually made a store run this LBP, in which case you convince someone else to go and roll again.
