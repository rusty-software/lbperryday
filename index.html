<p>In January of 2016, I had the harebrained idea to create a board game web app the content of which concerned an annual event known as Little Big Phil.  I passed the idea by Chris Chase, who thought it might be amusing and graciously agreed to help play test and generate content for the game.  I worked on it diligently for at least a couple of weeks before I got bored.  This site is the result.</p>

<a id="how-do-play" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How To Play</h3>

<p>LBP began as a weekend of camping, but has evolved into a 4-day glamping extravaganza.  As such, the game could be no less ridiculous than our annual antics.</p>

<h3>
<a id="players" class="anchor" href="#players" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Players</h3>

<p>The game is designed for 1 - 6 players.  It's best to have an even number of players, as some decisions made during the game depend on a majority ruling by the non-current player.</p>

<p>While the game is most enjoyable playing as yourself, you have the ability to play as anyone you choose.  For example, Phil might choose to play as Po instead of himself so that he can get a vicarious taste of single life for a while.  You don't even have to play as an LBP attendee, but you won't get as much out of the game if you don't.

<a id="starting-the-game" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starting The Game</h3>

<p>Decide who's going first.  This can be done however you like.  Flip coins, draw straws, roll dice, arm/leg wrestle, roshambo, or whatever else floats (or sinks) your boat.</p>

<p>Enter the player names, one at a time, in the text box and click Add Player.  The names will appear in a list below the buttons as you add them.  When all of the player names have been entered, click Start The Game!  Note that after you enter the sixth player name, the game will start automatically.</p>

<h3>
<a id="playing-the-game" class="anchor" href="#playing-the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Playing The Game</h3>


<p>Play begins with the first player in the player list.  The names are the playing pieces, and they initially appear above the playing area.</p>

<h4>Rolling and Moving</h4>
<p>Roll the dice, then click and drag your player name to the appropriate space, beginning with the top left most space and moving toward the center.  Next, click Draw Card.  Read the card text aloud and do what it says.  Finally, click End Turn.  Doing this will rotate the current player to the next player in the list.</p>

<h4>Dice</h4>
<p>Roll the dice by clicking on it.  The dice spins around if a new number is rolled (which doesn't always happen, just like in life).  Luckily, the current roll will appear atop a short list to the right of the dice.</p>

<h4>Cards</h4>
<p>Cards are the heart of the game.  They have titles and text, and are intended to be amusing.  Don't take them too seriously.  Just read them aloud, do what they say, and have fun with it.</p>

<p>Some cards have you move forward or back spaces, or lose turns, or roll again.  Moving backward or forward is done as a part of your turn, and generally will end your turn.  Losing your turn means that the next time your turn comes around, you should simply click End Turn without rolling or drawing a card.  Rolling again, however, is like an extra turn.  When you roll again, move your name appropriately and draw another card.</p>

<h4>Booty Traps/Calls</h4>
<p>Some spaces are special.  The first person to land on one of these spaces will enjoy a surprise!  Note that the Booty Call/Trap trumps other actions that would have been taken on the turn.</p>

<h4>Losing A Turn</h4>
<p>Sometimes, it happens -- you'll lose a turn.  When you lose a turn, pull one of the unused red dots over your name to designate that you've lost a turn.  On your next turn, remove the dot, but press the End Turn button immediately afterward without taking any other actions.  If you spring a booty trap/call while losing a turn, the effect applies as much as possible.</p>

<h3>
<a id="winning-the-game" class="anchor" href="#winning-the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Winning The Game</h3>

<p>The winner is the first player to land on the centermost space.  The game will announce the winner, and everyone should be congratulated for allowing that person to win, since obviously they wouldn't have won if you were playing the game more seriously...</p>
